# **Trello-Style Task Management Application**

## **Assignment Overview**

This project involves building a web-based task management application similar to Trello. The application includes user authentication, a task board, task management, drag-and-drop functionality, and data persistence.

## **Features**

1. **User Authentication**
   - Users can sign up and log in using email and password.
   - Secure password storage and session management.

2. **Task Board**
   - Users have a personal task board displayed upon logging in.
   - The board includes four columns: "To-Do", "In Progress", "Under Review", and "Completed".

3. **Task Management**
   - Users can create, edit, and delete tasks.
   - Each task includes:
     - **Title** (mandatory)
     - **Description** (optional)
     - **Status** (mandatory, auto-filled based on column)
     - **Priority** (optional; options: Low, Medium, Urgent)
     - **Deadline** (optional)

4. **Drag and Drop Functionality**
   - Users can move tasks between columns using drag-and-drop.
   - The task's status updates automatically based on the column.

5. **Data Persistence**
   - All data is stored in a database, ensuring that users can only view and manage their own tasks.
